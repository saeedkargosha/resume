When I was in university, I established a computer society to help fellow students learn new things. I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects. I listen to podcasts about life and career. For instance, I enjoy listening to Andrew Huberman, and I pay attention to both my physical and mental well-being. I also enjoy playing the piano and I am currently learning to play it. If you're interested, you can listen to Lang Lang - Intermezzo No. 1 in E Minor, a piece that I always enjoy. I have a strong inclination towards communication, both with people in general and within my career. With our team, we work together to tackle new challenges. I'm eager to learn more and take on new opportunities.\n"
