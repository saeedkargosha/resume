I have worked on multiple international projects of various scales in mobile, web apps, and backend development. My diverse background enables me to contribute across the entire stack, but my greatest strengths lie in front-end development. I have good knowledge of UI design, which allows me to bridge the gap between design and development. As a developer, I know how to deliver productive and maintainable software and take ownership of the quality of my work.'
